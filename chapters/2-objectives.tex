\section{Objectives}
This thesis aims to automate solving equaivalences over relational expressions in Coq. The goal is to manage to use the \texttt{egg} library and automate the proof process. The main objectives are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a framework for communication between Rust and \texttt{Coq} interactive proofs.
    \item Make a rule-parameterized algorithm on top of the \texttt{egg} library for producing a series of rewrites, which prove relational equivalence. Given two expressions and a rewriting system, there may be multiple approaches to prove the equivalence. 
    \item Experiment on existing proofs and used lemmas to come up with a usable and efficient rule set. Firstly, to analyse existing weak memory proofs and provide users a useful interface. Secondly, as big rule sets result in huge e-graphs, that take long to be built, we aim to research on the efficient and substantive rule set, that would be small enough to be used to build e-graphs in practice.
\end{itemize}
